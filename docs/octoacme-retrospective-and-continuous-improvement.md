# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template

- Description:
- Owner (Role):

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes

## Retrospective Prompts by Persona
Use these prompts to draw out role-specific insights during retrospectives:

- **UX Designer:** Were design assets ready early enough for development? Did we collect sufficient user feedback post-release?
- **DevOps Engineer:** Were deployments smooth and repeatable? What friction exists in the pipeline or infrastructure?
- **Business Analyst:** Were requirements clear and stable? Were there late-stage scope changes due to unclear requirements?
- **Support Lead:** How did customers respond post-release? Were the team notified of support trends fast enough to act?
- **Quality Lead:** Was test coverage sufficient? Were there unexpected defects or regressions? Was the QA timeline respected?
